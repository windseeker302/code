# Fruit Recognition with TensorFlow
Project Overview
This project leverages TensorFlow to build a neural network model capable of recognizing 26 types of fruits. By training the model on labeled image data, we provide an efficient solution for fruit classification, offering potential applications in agriculture, retail, and other industries.

Key Features
Accurate Recognition: The model can accurately classify 26 common fruit types, such as apples, bananas, and oranges.
High Efficiency: Optimized neural network architecture ensures quick and reliable predictions.
Modular Design: Clear and well-structured code allows for easy extension and customization.
Tech Stack
Framework: TensorFlow
Programming Language: Python
Deployment: Dockerized for seamless integration
Platform: Kubernetes with Istio for scalable and reliable model serving
Dataset
The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset consisting of images of 26 fruit types. Each image was preprocessed to ensure consistent input dimensions and quality. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing subsets for robust evaluation.
